# Clause Replacement Development Roadmap

## Branch: `update-clause`

This branch is dedicated to developing and enhancing the clause replacement functionality for the RHEI AI Legal Assistant Word Add-in.

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed (Main Branch)
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated modules
- **Contract Generation**: Fully working TSV-based contract generation
- **Basic Clause Replacement Structure**: Foundation modules created
- **UI Framework**: Modal system and styling in place
- **Word API Integration**: Document manipulation capabilities

### ðŸš§ In Development (This Branch)
- **Enhanced Clause Replacement**: Interactive clause selection and replacement
- **Legal Matrix Integration**: Real TSV-based alternative clause loading
- **Word API Document Analysis**: Reading and parsing existing contracts
- **Advanced UI Components**: Improved clause selection and preview

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Clause Replacement (Current)
**Goal**: Implement basic clause replacement functionality

#### Tasks:
1. **Document Analysis Integration**
   - Read existing Word documents
   - Parse and identify numbered clauses (1.1, 1.2, etc.)
   - Extract clause text for analysis

2. **TSV-Based Alternative Loading**
   - Load alternatives from ContentManagement.tsv and DataPro.tsv
   - Parse Legal Matrix columns (BASELINE, Yoola, Sony, Lionsgate)
   - Map clause numbers to available alternatives

3. **Interactive Clause Selection**
   - Click-to-select clauses in analyzed documents
   - Visual highlighting of selected clauses
   - Context menu or modal for replacement options

4. **Preview and Apply System**
   - Before/after preview of clause changes
   - Risk assessment display
   - Apply changes to Word document with Track Changes

### Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience
**Goal**: Improve usability and visual feedback

#### Tasks:
1. **Advanced UI Components**
   - Improved clause highlighting and selection
   - Better modal design for alternatives
   - Progress indicators for analysis and replacement

2. **Risk Assessment Integration**
   - Color-coded risk levels for alternatives
   - Detailed risk explanations
   - Recommendation system based on Legal Matrix

3. **Batch Operations**
   - Select multiple clauses for replacement
   - "Accept All Recommended Changes" functionality
   - Bulk risk assessment

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
**Goal**: Add sophisticated clause analysis and management

#### Tasks:
1. **Smart Clause Matching**
   - Fuzzy matching for clause identification
   - Handle variations in clause numbering
   - Context-aware clause recognition

2. **Legal Matrix Intelligence**
   - Dynamic alternative suggestions based on contract type
   - Party-specific recommendations (Yoola vs Sony vs Lionsgate)
   - Historical preference learning

3. **Integration with Contract Analysis**
   - Seamless workflow from analysis to replacement
   - Automated flagging of problematic clauses
   - Compliance checking against Legal Matrix standards

## Technical Implementation

### Key Files to Enhance

#### `src/features/clause-replacement.js`
- **Current**: Basic modal and selection framework
- **Target**: Full clause replacement workflow
- **Enhancements**:
  - Real TSV data integration
  - Word API document reading
  - Advanced clause matching algorithms

#### `src/services/api-service.js`
- **Current**: TSV loading and parsing
- **Target**: Legal Matrix intelligence
- **Enhancements**:
  - Alternative clause extraction by party
  - Risk assessment algorithms
  - Clause matching services

#### `src/features/contract-analysis.js`
- **Current**: Demo analysis display
- **Target**: Real document analysis
- **Enhancements**:
  - Word document parsing
  - Clause extraction and numbering
  - Integration with replacement workflow

### New Components to Create

#### `src/services/document-analyzer.js`
- Word document reading and parsing
- Clause identification and extraction
- Document structure analysis

#### `src/services/legal-matrix.js`
- Legal Matrix data processing
- Alternative clause management
- Risk assessment logic

#### `src/utils/clause-matcher.js`
- Clause number parsing and matching
- Fuzzy text matching for clause identification
- Context-aware clause recognition

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Individual module testing for clause matching
- TSV parsing and Legal Matrix data extraction
- Risk assessment algorithm validation

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end clause replacement workflow
- Word API integration testing
- Modal and UI component testing

### User Acceptance Tests
- Real contract analysis and replacement scenarios
- Performance testing with large documents
- Cross-browser compatibility (Word Online)

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success Metrics
- [ ] Successfully read and parse Word documents
- [ ] Identify and highlight clickable clauses
- [ ] Load real alternatives from TSV files
- [ ] Apply clause replacements to Word documents
- [ ] Basic risk level display

### Phase 2 Success Metrics
- [ ] Intuitive user interface for clause selection
- [ ] Clear risk assessment and recommendations
- [ ] Batch replacement operations
- [ ] Seamless integration with contract generation

### Phase 3 Success Metrics
- [ ] Smart clause matching with 95%+ accuracy
- [ ] Party-specific recommendations
- [ ] Full Legal Matrix intelligence integration
- [ ] Production-ready performance and reliability

## Development Workflow

### Branch Management
- **Main Branch**: Stable, production-ready code
- **update-clause Branch**: Active development for clause replacement
- **Feature Branches**: Individual features branched from update-clause

### Commit Strategy
- Frequent commits with clear, descriptive messages
- Feature-based commits for easy rollback
- Regular merges from main to stay current

### Testing Protocol
- Test each feature in isolation
- Integration testing before commits
- Word Online testing for each major change

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Document Analysis**: Implement Word document reading and clause extraction
2. **TSV Integration**: Connect real Legal Matrix data to replacement system
3. **UI Enhancement**: Improve clause selection and modal interfaces
4. **Word API Integration**: Implement document modification with Track Changes
5. **Testing and Refinement**: Comprehensive testing and user feedback integration

This roadmap provides a clear path for developing robust clause replacement functionality while maintaining the modular architecture and ensuring seamless integration with existing features.
