ARTICLE 2	2.1	Channel Management Services	"RHEI will provide Channel Management Services as detailed in Schedule ""B"" for Provider Channels listed in Schedule ""A"" or as mutually agreed."	"RHEI shall provide Provider with the ""Channel Management Services"" as set out in Schedule ""B"" attached hereto (the ""Channel Management Services"") in connection with the Provider Channels set out in Schedule ""A"" attached hereto or any other Provider Channels mutually agreed upon by the parties in writing (email to suffice) (collectively, the ""Managed Channels"")."	"RHEI shall provide Provider with the ""Channel Management Services"" as set out in Schedule ""B"" attached hereto (the ""Channel Management Services"") in connection with the Provider Channels set out in Schedule ""A"" attached hereto or any other Provider Channels mutually agreed upon by the parties in writing (email to suffice) (collectively, the ""Managed Channels"")."	"WMX contract adds ""solely"" and explicitly states that all services, including video uploads, are subject to Provider approval as per Schedules A and B."	Found in Article 3.3; BBTV provides full management services for 'Managed Channels'.	?	Matched in Article 2.1 of Lionsgate�BBTV DVSA under 'Channel Management Services' as described in Schedule B.	?
ARTICLE 2	2.2	Content Development Services	"RHEI will provide Content Development Services as detailed in Schedule ""C""."	"RHEI shall provide Provider with the ""Content Development Services"" as set out in Schedule ""C"" attached hereto (the ""Content Development Services"")."	"RHEI shall provide Provider with the ""Content Development Services"" as set out in Schedule ""C"" attached hereto (the ""Content Development Services"")."	"The WMX contract has a completely different clause for 2.2, focusing on access and security of Managed Channels, while Ninja Tune and MNRK have Content Development Services here."	Not present. No standalone content development clause equivalent to Schedule C in newer agreements.	"CBMG refers to Schedule ""D"" instead of Schedule ""C"" for Content Development Services."	Matched in Article 2.2 and Schedule C of Lionsgate�BBTV DVSA.	?
ARTICLE 2	2.3	RHEI Reports	"RHEI will provide monthly reports on impressions, revenues, and viewership data for Managed Channels and views/revenues for Provider Content on RHEI Owned and Operated Channels, subject to Google's reporting."	"Subject to RHEI's receipt of the necessary reports from Google, RHEI shall provide to Provider the following reports in connection with the Services as follows: Channel Management Services: (a) (i) a monthly report showing the impressions and revenues on a per-Title basis; and (ii) a monthly report regarding such viewership data monthly on a per-Title basis with respect to Managed Channels as RHEI may obtain from time to time. (b) RHEI Owned and Operated Channels: (i) a monthly report showing the views and revenues for Provider Content on RHEI Owner and Operated Channels on a per-Title basis. RHEI may provide Provider with additional or other reports as mutually agreed to in writing by the parties (email to suffice)."	"Subject to RHEI's receipt of the necessary reports from Google, RHEI shall provide to Provider the following reports in connection with the Services as follows: (a) Channel Management Services: (i) a monthly report showing the impressions and revenues on a per-Title basis; and (ii) a monthly report regarding such viewership data monthly on a per-Title basis with respect to Managed Channels as RHEI may obtain from time to time. (b) RHEI Owned and Operated Channels: (i) a monthly report showing the views and revenues for Provider Content on RHEI Owner and Operated Channels on a per-Title basis. RHEI may provide Provider with additional or other reports as mutually agreed to in writing by the parties (email to suffice). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Provider may opt out at any time during the Term of any particular services offered by RHEI, including without limitation services which are already performed on Provider's behalf by a third party."	"The WMX contract's 2.3 is Content Development Services, which is 2.2 in Ninja Tune/MNRK. This means a shift in clause numbering and content."	Covered in Article 3.4 and 3.5 under 'Attribution Reporting' and 'Dashboard Reports'.	"CBMG's 2.3 (RHEI Reports) is missing the section about ""RHEI Owned and Operated Channels"" that is present in Ninja Tune's 2.3."	Equivalent in Article 2.3 of Lionsgate�BBTV DVSA as 'BBTV Reports'.	The MNRK contract adds a clause allowing Provider to opt out of particular RHEI services at any time during the Term.
ARTICLE 2	2.4	Advertising Approvals	"RHEI will propose advertising categories, and Provider's approval is deemed granted if no written objection is received within 48 hours."	"Unless the Parties mutually agree to a different approval process in writing, RHEI shall consult with and propose to Provider the types of advertising categories that may be placed on or in connection with Provider Content under this Agreement, and if no written objection from Provider is received by RHEI within forty-eight (48) hours of the delivery of such proposal, Provider's approval for such proposal shall be deemed granted."	"Unless the Parties mutually agree to a different approval process in writing, RHEI shall consult with and propose to Provider the types of advertising categories that may be placed on or in connection with Provider Content under this Agreement, and if no written objection from Provider is received by RHEI within forty-eight (48) hours of the delivery of such proposal, Provider's approval for such proposal shall be deemed granted."	"The clause numbers are shifted in WMX. WMX has a much more detailed reporting section (2.4) compared to Ninja Tune/MNRK (2.3). The ""Advertising Approvals"" clause from Ninja Tune's 2.4 does not appear to have a direct equivalent in WMX's Article 2."	No reference to Provider approving ad categories. BBTV manages ad monetization independently.	"CBMG LLC does not have an ""Advertising Approvals"" clause in Article 2."	"No clause on advertising category approvals by provider found in BBTV DVSA. BBTV has broad rights under 3.3(b) to sell, place, and manage ads."	?
ARTICLE 3	3.1	Provider Obligations	"Provider must provide RHEI with administrative access and metadata for Provider Channels, and include RHEI Owned and Operated Channels on its Content Owner System Allowlist, as reasonably requested by RHEI."	"Without limiting any other obligations of Provider set out in this Agreement, for the purposes of this Agreement, solely to the extent necessary for RHEI to provide the Services, Provider will take reasonable actions as may be necessary or desirable in order to: (a) Channel Management Services: (i) provide RHEI with administrative access to the Provider Channels; and (ii) provide RHEI with metadata for the Provider Channels and the Titles appearing thereon, as RHEI may reasonably request from time to time. (b) Provider's Content Owner System: (i) Include RHEI Owned and Operated Channels on Provider's Content Owner System permissions list (the """"Allowlist"""") as RHEI may reasonably request from time to time."	"Without limiting any other obligations of Provider set out in this Agreement, for the purposes of this Agreement, solely to the extent necessary for RHEI to provide the Services, Provider will take reasonable actions as may be necessary or desirable in order to: (a) Channel Management Services: (i) provide RHEI with administrative access to the Managed Channels; and (ii) provide RHEI with metadata for the Managed Channels and the Titles appearing thereon, as RHEI may reasonably request from time to time. (b) Provider's Content Owner System: (i) Include RHEI Owned and Operated Channels on Provider's Content Owner System permissions list (the """"Allowlist"""") as RHEI may reasonably request from time to time"	"WMX has a specific """"CMS System"""" clause, detailing limited administrative access for BBTV, while Ninja Tune/MNRK have a broader """"Provider Obligations"""" clause that includes providing administrative access and metadata. The """"Provider's Content Owner System"""" part of 3.1 in Ninja Tune/MNRK is not explicitly in WMX's 3.1, but aspects of it might be covered by general """"Provider Obligations"""" in WMX's 3.2."	"See Article 5.1; outlines metadata provision, CMS co-management, and hosting services."	"CBMG's 3.1 is a ""CO System"" clause, specifically about incorporating Managed Channels into RHEI's content owner system (""CO""), which is different from Ninja Tune's broader ""Provider Obligations"" that includes administrative access and metadata, and an ""Allowlist"" for RHEI Owned and Operated Channels."	Covered in Article 3.2 of BBTV DVSA.	"In 3.1(a)(i), ""Provider Channels"" is changed to ""Managed Channels"" in the MNRK contract."
ARTICLE 3	3.2	Provider License	"Provider grants RHEI a non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable license to use, manage, adapt, edit, and exploit Provider Content and Brand Features on Managed Channels and RHEI Owned and Operated Channels for the purpose of providing Services."

"Provider hereby grants to RHEI, during the Term, a non-exclusive (except with respect to Provider), royalty-free, and sublicensable (but only to RHEI's Affiliates and only for the purposes of this Agreement) right and license in the Territory to: (a) use, manage, adapt, edit, modify, compile, prepare derivative works based on, encode, copy, store, reformat, analyze, advertise, promote, publish, transmit, host, cache, analyze, and otherwise use and deal with the Provider Brand Features and Provider Content on the Managed Channels for the strict purpose of RHEI providing the Services to Provider in accordance with this Agreement, and (b) to use the rights set out in (a) above for the purposes of exploiting and/or monetizing Provider Content on or through the RHEI Owned and Operated Channels."	"Clause 3.2 in WMX is about Provider's general obligations (similar to 3.1 in Ninja Tune/MNRK), while in Ninja Tune/MNRK, 3.2 is the """"Provider License"""" clause. The """"Provider License"""" clause from Ninja Tune/MNRK does not have a direct equivalent in WMX's Article 3."	Article 4.1(a) grants BBTV broad licenses for claiming and monetization.	"CBMG's 3.2 is ""Provider Obligations"", which is similar to Ninja Tune's 3.1(a) and does not include the ""Allowlist"" part from Ninja Tune's 3.1(b)."	"Article 3.3 of BBTV DVSA grants BBTV a non-exclusive, royalty-free license for content management and ad placement."	"The MNRK contract adds ""during the Term"" to the grant of license."
ARTICLE 3	3.3	Prohibitions	"Prohibits both parties from generating invalid queries, impressions, or clicks on Ads or accessing Provider Content through automated, deceptive, or fraudulent means."	"Neither party shall (and shall not authorize or encourage any third party to), directly or indirectly generate queries, impressions of or clicks on any Ads or to obtain access to Provider Content through any automated, deceptive, fraudulent or other invalid means, including but not limited to through repeated manual clicks, the use of robots or other automated query tools and/or computer generated search requests, and/or the fraudulent use of other search engine optimization services and/or software.

Each party reserves the right to investigate, at its own discretion, any activity that may violate this Agreement, including but not limited to any use of a software application to access Ads or any engagement in any activity prohibited by this Agreement."	"Clause 3.3 in WMX is """"Policies and Applicable Law"""" (similar to 3.4 in Ninja Tune/MNRK), while in Ninja Tune/MNRK, 3.3 is """"Prohibitions."""" The """"Prohibitions"""" clause from Ninja Tune/MNRK does not appear to have a direct equivalent in WMX's Article 3."	"Detailed in Article 5.2; includes fraud, bot traffic, and invalid clicks."	"CBMG's 3.3 is ""Provider License"" and grants an *exclusive* license (except with respect to Provider) and explicitly includes the right to ""sell, place and manage Ads"" on Managed Channels, which is different from Ninja Tune's non-exclusive license without explicit ad sales rights."	Article 3.4 includes detailed prohibitions on invalid ad traffic or fraudulent practices.	?
ARTICLE 3	3.4	Policies and Applicable Law	Parties must comply with applicable Google policies and all applicable laws in connection with their performance under the Agreement.	"All obligations of the parties in this Agreement shall be subject to all applicable Google policies posted on YouTube or otherwise applicable to RHEI and/or Provider.

Each party hereby agrees to comply with all applicable law in connection with its performance under this Agreement."	"All obligations of the parties in this Agreement shall be subject to all applicable Google policies posted on YouTube or otherwise applicable to RHEI and/or Provider.

Each party hereby agrees to comply with all applicable law in connection with its performance under this Agreement."	This clause (3.4) in Ninja Tune/MNRK is covered by 3.3 in WMX.	"Implicit throughout and references Google's policies, especially in Article 5.2."	"CBMG's 3.4 is ""Prohibitions"", which is identical in content to Ninja Tune's 3.3. This is a re-numbering."
