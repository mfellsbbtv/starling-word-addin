# RHEI AI Legal Assistant - Architecture Overview

## Repository Purpose

This repository contains the **RHEI AI Legal Assistant**, a Microsoft Word add-in designed for AI-powered contract analysis and generation. The application enables legal professionals to analyze existing contracts, generate new contracts from templates, and apply intelligent clause modifications based on predefined legal playbooks.

## Infrastructure Components

### Frontend Components
- **Taskpane Interface**: Primary user interface built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Contract Generation Engine**: TSV-based template processing system
- **Contract Analysis Engine**: AI-powered contract review and clause analysis
- **Form Management**: Dynamic form fields for contract customization

### Backend Services
- **Legal Matrix Service**: Processes legal contract templates and playbooks
- **Contract Parser**: Extracts and analyzes contract structure and clauses
- **Playbook Service**: Manages contract templates and clause libraries
- **Excel Integration**: Handles spreadsheet-based contract data

### Data Layer
- **TSV Templates**: Tab-separated value files containing contract clauses
- **Legal Playbooks**: Structured contract templates with clause variations
- **Configuration Files**: Environment-specific settings and parameters

### Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)
- **ECS Services**: Containerized application hosting
- **RDS Database**: Persistent data storage
- **CloudFront CDN**: Content delivery and caching
- **S3 Storage**: Static asset and document storage
- **VPC Networking**: Secure network isolation

## Technology Stack

### Frontend Technologies
- **HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript**: Core web technologies
- **Office.js API**: Microsoft Office integration framework
- **Webpack**: Module bundling and build system
- **Babel**: JavaScript transpilation for compatibility

### Backend Technologies
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime
- **Express.js**: Web application framework
- **Docker**: Containerization platform

### Infrastructure Technologies
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool
- **AWS**: Primary cloud platform
- **GitHub Pages**: Development hosting (fallback)
- **HTTPS/SSL**: Secure communication protocols

### Development Tools
- **ESLint**: Code quality and style enforcement
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **Office Add-in CLI**: Microsoft Office development tools
- **Webpack Dev Server**: Local development environment

## Environment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: HTTPS server at `localhost:3000`
- **Hot Reload**: Automatic code updates during development
- **Debug Mode**: Enhanced logging and error reporting
- **Mock Data**: Sample contracts and test scenarios

### Staging Environment
- **GitHub Pages**: Intermediate testing environment
- **Production-like Configuration**: Mirrors production settings
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow validation

### Production Environment
- **AWS ECS**: Scalable container hosting
- **Custom Domain**: Professional branded URL
- **SSL Certificates**: Secure HTTPS communication
- **Monitoring**: Application performance and health tracking

## Deployment Patterns

### Local Development Deployment
1. **Build Process**: Webpack compilation of source files
2. **Local Server**: Express.js HTTPS server with CORS support
3. **Manifest Loading**: Direct manifest upload to Word Online
4. **Live Reload**: Automatic updates during development

### Cloud Deployment
1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Terraform-managed AWS resources
2. **Container Build**: Docker image creation and registry push
3. **Service Deployment**: ECS service updates with rolling deployment
4. **DNS Configuration**: Route53 domain management
5. **SSL Certificate**: ACM certificate provisioning

### Continuous Integration
- **Automated Testing**: Code quality and functionality validation
- **Build Automation**: Webpack compilation and optimization
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Staged rollout to production environment

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. **Monolithic Add-in Architecture**
- **Decision**: Single-page application with modular JavaScript services
- **Rationale**: Simplifies deployment and reduces complexity for Office add-in constraints
- **Trade-offs**: Easier maintenance vs. potential scalability limitations

### 2. **TSV-Based Template System**
- **Decision**: Use tab-separated value files for contract templates
- **Rationale**: Legal teams can easily edit templates in Excel/spreadsheet applications
- **Trade-offs**: Human-readable format vs. more complex data structures

### 3. **Client-Side Contract Generation**
- **Decision**: Process contract templates in the browser/Word environment
- **Rationale**: Reduces server load and enables offline functionality
- **Trade-offs**: Performance in browser vs. server-side processing power

### 4. **Fixed Company Information**
- **Decision**: Hard-code RHEI company details in the application
- **Rationale**: All contracts are generated by RHEI, eliminating user input errors
- **Trade-offs**: Simplified UX vs. flexibility for multi-tenant use

### 5. **Hybrid Hosting Strategy**
- **Decision**: Support both local development and cloud production environments
- **Rationale**: Enables rapid development while providing scalable production deployment
- **Trade-offs**: Increased configuration complexity vs. deployment flexibility

### 6. **Direct Word API Integration**
- **Decision**: Use Office.js APIs for direct document manipulation
- **Rationale**: Seamless user experience within familiar Word environment
- **Trade-offs**: Platform dependency vs. native integration benefits

## Security Considerations

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All communication encrypted in transit
- **CORS Configuration**: Controlled cross-origin resource sharing
- **Input Validation**: Sanitization of user-provided contract data
- **AWS Security Groups**: Network-level access controls
- **Certificate Management**: Automated SSL certificate renewal

## Performance Optimization

- **Webpack Optimization**: Code splitting and minification
- **CDN Distribution**: CloudFront for global content delivery
- **Caching Strategy**: Browser and CDN caching for static assets
- **Lazy Loading**: On-demand loading of contract templates
- **Text Justification**: Client-side formatting for professional appearance
