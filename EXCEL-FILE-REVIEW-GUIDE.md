# Legal Matrix Excel File Review Guide

## üéØ **How to Share Your Excel Structure**

Since I can't directly read Excel files without additional libraries, here are the best ways to share your "Legal Matrix - Test.xlsx" structure for review:

### **Option 1: Export to CSV (Recommended)**
1. Open your Excel file
2. For each sheet, go to **File > Save As > CSV (Comma delimited)**
3. Save each sheet as a separate CSV file:
   - `ContractTemplates.csv`
   - `ClauseLibrary.csv` 
   - `RiskRules.csv`
   - `VariableMappings.csv`

### **Option 2: Copy and Paste Sample Data**
Share the first 5-10 rows of each sheet in this format:

```
Sheet Name: Contract Templates
Headers: ContractType,ContentType,Section,Order,Title,Content,Required,Variables
Row 1: content-management,music,preamble,1,PREAMBLE,"This agreement...",TRUE,"CompanyName,ProviderName"
Row 2: content-management,music,services,2,SERVICES,"Manager will...",TRUE,ServiceScope
```

### **Option 3: Screenshot Key Sections**
Take screenshots of:
- Column headers for each sheet
- First few rows of data
- Any special formatting or formulas
