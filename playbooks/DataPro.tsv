"All undefined capitalized terms in these Terms and Conditions have the meanings given to them in the Cover Sheet. Otherwise, in these Terms and Conditions: “Affiliate” means, with respect to a Party, any other entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such Party. For the purposes of this definition, the term “control” means the direct or indirect power to direct the affairs of the other entity through voting power, economic or contractual interest, or otherwise. “Authorized Signatory” means, where You are a company or other entity, the individual who signed the Cover Sheet as Your Authorized Signatory. “Biometric Data” means any information in Your Content (such as descriptions of human characteristics including, without limitation, measurements or scans of face geometry or voiceprints) that, under applicable law or regulation, could be considered “biometric identifiers”, “biometric information”, or that could fall into an analogous legal or regulatory category. For purposes of this Agreement, Biometric Data is Personal Information. “Crowdsourcing” means any information gathering method or process that involves a general solicitation for third-party contributors to submit assets (and grant rights) to Licensor pursuant to substantially similar license terms that are made publicly available to all contributors, where contributors are not required to have any prior business relationship with Licensor in order to participate (e.g., a marketplace model). “Data Protection Legislation” means applicable statutes, laws, and regulations relating to privacy, security, or protection of Personal Information and inclusive of any subsequent supplements, amendments, or replacements to the same. Data Protection Legislation includes, to the extent applicable, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation 2016/679) (“GDPR”); the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended (“CCPA”); the Washington My Health My Data Act (“MHMDA”); and the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (“BIPA”). “Deliverables” has the meaning set forth in Section 3.1. “Deliverable Specifications” means any correspondence, document, or materials provided to Licensor by RHEI which sets out the required technical parameters or specifications applicable to Your delivery of Your Content to RHEI under this Agreement. “IP Rights” means all existing and future worldwide copyrights and related rights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, rights of privacy, rights of publicity, moral rights, copyright anti-circumvention rights, database rights, and all other intellectual property and proprietary rights. “Metadata” means any information included in or provided with Your Content, or any portion thereof, that is used to identify, label, sort, or present a data element, including attributions, captions, labels, annotations, descriptions, tags, and keywords. “Personal Information” is given the meaning under the applicable privacy or data protection laws (including Data Protection Legislation) relating to this term or any analogous term (such as “personal data”).

(This section adds a critical qualification that additional rights/licenses are "limited to the Purpose" and subject to other limitations in the Cover Sheet. It also includes an explicit overarching statement that all "additional rights and licenses shall be subject to, and limited to the extent necessary to effectuate, the Purpose.")

(The specific enumeration of rights in the baseline (i, ii, iii) is replaced with more generalized language focusing on development and research. The "Artifacts" clause from the baseline's Schedule A (2.2) is moved into this clause in Asylum, becoming a sub-section of the License grant, and changes "RHEI and each Sublicensee" to "RHEI" for Artifacts ownership.)

(This section is dramatically restructured and expanded, now titled "SUBLICENSES; OWNERSHIP." It explicitly defines the Sublicenses RHEI can grant, including their perpetual and irrevocable nature. It also adds new clauses regarding Sublicensee ownership of artifacts, API access for Sublicensees, limitations on RHEI/Sublicensee actions under applicable law (e.g., fair use), and specific language around "Legally Necessary Rights." It also seems to omit the initial umbrella "Non-exclusive License" general grant from the baseline, replacing it with a direct discussion of sublicenses.)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, RHEI’s right to access, ingest, and use Licensor Content for the purpose of training, tuning, or creating new AI or machine-learning models shall apply only during the Term, and shall expire automatically at the end of the Term. This restriction does not affect the perpetual rights, or any other rights such as those contained in the immediately preceding sentence, of Sublicensees whose Sublicenses were entered into during the Term, but no new ingestion shall occur thereafter without Licensor’s renewed authorization."  (The license to sublicense is clarified to exclude "through multiple tiers" for affiliates, sublicensees etc. The clause also adds a significant new paragraph restricting RHEI's direct right to access, ingest, and use content for training AI models to only during the Term, expiring automatically at the end of the Term. This is a material limitation on RHEI's rights for its own purposes, though it clarifies that perpetual rights of Sublicensees entered into during the term are unaffected.)
