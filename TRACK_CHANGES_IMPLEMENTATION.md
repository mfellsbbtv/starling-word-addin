    `${clauseNumber}.`,      // "2.3."
    `${clauseNumber} `,      // "2.3 "
    `Article ${clauseNumber}`,  // "Article 2.3"
    `Section ${clauseNumber}`,  // "Section 2.3"
    clauseNumber             // "2.3"
];
```

### 3. **In-Place Replacement**
```javascript
// Find the clause range
const expandedRange = range.expandTo(range.paragraph.getRange());

// Replace with track changes
expandedRange.insertText(newClauseText, Word.InsertLocation.replace);
```

### 4. **Comment Integration**
```javascript
// Add explanatory comment
insertedRange.insertComment(
    `Clause ${clauseNumber} replaced with ${selectedAlternative.title} version via RHEI AI Legal Assistant`
);
```
