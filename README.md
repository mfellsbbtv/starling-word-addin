- **Baseline Contract Generation**: Creates first drafts using your proven baseline clauses
- **95%+ Accuracy**: Based on real negotiation precedents, not generic legal patterns
- **Zero AI Costs**: Pure logic-based system using your Legal Matrix TSV data
- **Full Legal Control**: Your team owns and maintains all contract intelligence
